# Pre-workshop downloads

Please download the pre-requisite software onto your laptop computer before you attend the workshop. This helps speed things up on Friday and helps prevent the WiFi network from getting clogged.


## OS X 10.6 and above:

Pick one of the following options. The main difference is that Option 1  will
install Ruby and various tools directly into your computer operating system,
whereas Option 2 will install a temporary and easy-to-remove "virtual machine"
containing all the software you need for the workshop.

### Option 1. RailsInstaller

Download Railsinstaller from the <a href="http://railsinstaller.org" target="_blank">RailsInstaller</a> webpage.

Don't worry about watching the video. Just leave the download in your Downloads folder.

### Option 2. Railsbridge Virtual Machine

Download
[VirtualBox](http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.2.18/VirtualBox-4.2.18-88780-OSX.dmg)
for Mac. Run the installer after it downloads.

Download [Vagrant](http://files.vagrantup.com/packages/db8e7a9c79b23264da129f55cf8569167fc22415/Vagrant-1.3.3.dmg) for Mac. Run the installer after it downloads.


## OS X 10.5

Go to the [Apple Developer Center](https://developer.apple.com/downloads),
and click Register. Fill out the first page with your account information.
The second page is a developer survey, which you can skip. Just go to the bottom and click
"Continue".

Once you have confirmed your developer account, you can download [Xcode
3.1.4](http://adcdownload.apple.com/Developer_Tools/xcode_3.1.4_developer_tools/xcode314_2809_developerdvd.dmg).
If that link doesn't work, go to the [downloads
page](https://developer.apple.com/downloads) and search for "Xcode 3.1.4"



## Windows

Note that unlike the OS X instructions, these are not multiple options - you
should do all of the steps below.

Download
[VirtualBox](http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.2.18/VirtualBox-4.2.18-88781-Win.exe)
for Windows. Run the installer after it downloads. You can quit the application
if it launches at the end of the installation.

Download
[Vagrant](http://files.vagrantup.com/packages/db8e7a9c79b23264da129f55cf8569167fc22415/Vagrant_1.3.3.msi)
for Windows. Run the installer after it downloads. Agree to restart the computer if you're prompted to do so.

Download [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com/) and run the installer.
If prompted during installation, install the Microsoft .NET framework.
If GitHub for Windows automatically launches after installation, quit the application.


## Linux

Nothing to do yet. Come to the workshop on Friday.
