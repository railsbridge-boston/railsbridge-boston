On February 22 and March 2, RailsBridge Boston proudly held its fourth workshop
for women and their friends at MIT. 

The mission of RailsBridge Boston workshops is to to give a mostly female
audience a guided, friendly, empowering, inspiring, and fun introduction to
building web applications with the Ruby programming language. 

RailsBridge Boston started running introductory Rails workshops in August of
2012. We were inspired to run these workshops when we saw a presentation about
the [outreach efforts by the Boston Python community](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrITN6GZDu4) 
to welcome more women and beginners into their ranks.  The Boston Python effort
had been inspired in turn by the original
[RailsBridge](http://workshops.railsbridge.org/) diversity outreach effort to
bring more women into the Ruby comunity in San Francisco. 

We originally set out to run a large workshop on February 22nd and 23rd with
over 60 students and over 25 teaching assistants. We got through the Friday
night installfest smoothly on the night of the 22nd. We were set to run through
the main curriculum the next day. 

Early Saturday morning, on February 23, reports spread of a man with long rifle
roaming MIT campus. About 15 RailsBridge students and teaching assistants had
already showed up early for the workshop to start when MIT police advised
everyone on the main campus to stay indoors and locks their doors. Other
workshop volunteers got wind of the emergency by email and opted to
stay home to wait it out.

In the midst of uncertainty, we decided to cancel the Saturday workshop and
reschedule for the following weekend. Less than an hour after that MIT
announced the police had found no shooter and lifted the emergency. Later it
was revealed that the original tip was a hoax.

The shooter hoax cost us some money and attendance. We losts a few hundred
dollars for breakfast which had been laid out but was left unconsumed. About
half our original student pool also couldn't make the makeup Saturday workshop
day because of schedule conflicts.  But we forged ahead, with generous
understanding and support from MIT Catering, our sponsors, our teaching staff,
and our students. 

On Saturday, March 2, we ran our make-up workshop. 32 beginners, 27 of them
women, spent a little over 5 hours building and deploying their first Rails web
application.  They were guided by 17 teaching assistants through exercises and
6 lectures on the whole range of skills involved in web application
development, from text editors and basic Ruby syntax to Git source control,
ActiveRecord associations, and pushing code to the web through Heroku.

We were also lucky to to have two bonus inspirational presentations by Diana
Kimball and Jessica McKellar. With colorful slides, Diana shared a story of her
own journey into programming, from a state of complete intimidation to
confidence and empowerment. Jessica gave a strong, encouraging speech about the
steps beginners could take after the workshop and projects they could undertake
to further their self-development as programmers.


## The feedback

Our exit survey results were encouraging. The survey was completed by 11 of the
attendees who made it through both days of the workshop. 8 people rated the
workshop as a 5 out of 5, and the other 3 gave it a 4.

The respondents were grateful for the TAs and the lectures, and in general all
the volunteer work that went into making the workshop:

> I was incredibly impressed by all the talented individuals who were willing
  to give their time as lecturers and TAs. I think it was very valuable to have
  so many knowledgeable people willing to help out whenever I had a question. 

--

> The T.A.s were amazing!! They were so helpful and nice. They really know
  their stuff.

--

> Everyone was very helpful and I will definitely be playing around with
  Ruby in my spare time!! :) Thanks everyone!!

--

> Lecture/activities were really good

--

> I thought the mix of activities was effective. Also, I was glad that Friday was
  devoted to correctly installing the needed components. I think this made the
  workshop much more approachable, and it was nice to get help with the
  difficulties of installation. Thank you very much for putting together this
  excellent opportunity! I appreciate all the time it takes to execute such a
  workshop.


But there was constructive criticism as well. Some people pointed out the
slowness of the WiFi network and the scarcity of USB install sticks during
Installfest, One person thought that the Friday installfest was a bit slow and
under-structured:

> Installfest was slow, and it didn't feel like there was really enough to do
  while we waited for downloads and installation. Maybe that would be a good
  time to either cover some of the background/structure or look at some of the
  vocabulary? (At least in an independent reading setup, perhaps.)

More than one person thought the curriculum covered too much too fast, and
suggested that we could try harder to impart clear, organizing concepts. 

> About 2/3 of the way through the day I found myself pretty lost. I could
  follow along the steps pretty well but couldn't conceptually wrap my head
  around what I was doing, even after talking with my TA. This might just be
  part of the process though, there's only so much you can learn in one day!

--

> I get the basic logic of programming, but I felt like I was skating over the
  top of a lot of information without having all the tools I wanted for really
  understanding it better. I could guess from reading the tutorial's directions
  what the commands would do, but I would've liked a bit more detail as to how
  to construct commands.

Since RailsBridge Boston started running its own workshops in August, we've
help inspire more women's workshop efforts in other cities through the 
writeups, photos, and survey results we've posted of our events..
