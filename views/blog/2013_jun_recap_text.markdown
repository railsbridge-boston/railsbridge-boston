On a sunny Saturday morning in June, over 100 techies piled into the 
Microsoft NERD center by the Charles River in Cambrdige.  68 students
and 35 teaching assistants worked through a curriculum of Ruby, 
Rails, HTML, and CSS.  Armed with laptops, a projector, and 
determination the students built fully functional web applications, 
deployed on Heroku servers for all the world to see.  

The Boston Railsbridge Workshop for women and their friends was first
held in August of 2012.  It set out to improve the diversity of an 
increasingly-homogenized community of Ruby developers in Boston.  

Since then, 4 more workshops have been held and over 200 students 
have run through its lessons.  At the June workshop, 64 of the 68 
attending students identified as women.  Students range from 
entrepreneurs to college undergraduates to those just looking for a
career change.  The workshop aims to act as an entry point into the
often exclusive or intimidating world of open source developoment.
The curriculum assumes no prior experience with programming and 
application development.  On Friday evening, students install 
Ruby, Rails, Git, Heroku, and other necessary libraries.  Then, 
with the aids of their TAs, they work through a series of lessons
to build their own survey application.  In addition, several 
lectures are given to introduce topics, such as Ruby syntax and the 
Model-View-Controller pattern.  The workshop wrapped up with a 
cooldown at the Cambridge Brewing Company, where students and TAs 
shared tips, business cards, and a few beverages.  

### TA-to-Student Ratio

This workshop was our largest yet, both in terms of students and 
teaching assistants.  Thanks to the vibrant Boston Ruby community 
and the tireless work of the organizers, we were able to approach 
a ratio of 2 students for every 1 teaching assistant.  In addition, 
many students of previous workshops came back to be teaching 
assistants for this workshop.  In previous workshops, we'd found 
that the number of teaching assistants was overwhelmingly the most 
lauded feature of the workshop amongst students, and we feel like 
it is the key to our success.

### Childcare

Thanks to sponsorship from [Thoughtbot](http://www.thoughtbot.com/), we 
were able to ofter childcare assistance during the workshop.  One 
mother left us particularly kind feedback.

>  I'd like to extend the most heartfelt of thank-yous to those who 
>  made childcare possible. I felt entirely comfortable leaving my 
>  two-year-old with the person the service sent, and without the 
>  childcare I wouldn't have been able to attend at all. I appreciate 
>  the organizers thinking of (single) moms who want to code more than 
>  I can say.

### Updated Curriculum

Before each workshop, we do our best to take into account any 
suggestions made and keep all references to technology up to date.  
We faced an interesting quandary with Rails 4.0, which was to be 
released imminently at the time of the workshop.  In the end, we 
decided to stick with 3.2.  

If you would like to help out with the curriculum, head over to 
[our github page](https://github.com/railsbridge-boston/railsbridge-boston) 
and raise a discussion or make a pull request.

### Continuing Education

A common suggestion from previous attendees was that they often 
felt confused as to what they should do after the workshop.  Anyone 
who has tried to teach themselves a new technology knows that it 
can be just like a minotaur's labyrinth, full of misleading paths 
and shifting sands.  Before we closed out this workshop, we made a 
special note of showing different resources and tutorials that 
were appropriately challenging and informative.

Thanks to our awesome sponsors, we were also able to offer our 
graduates several freebies and deals.  Every student was able to 
choose an [O'Reilly E-book](http://oreilly.com/) for free.  Ryan 
Bates was kind enough to offer some free subscriptions to 
[Railscasts](railscasts.com) and [Thoughtbot](http://www.thoughtbot.com) provided 
a discount to their education service, [Prime](https://learn.thoughtbot.com/prime).  

Finally, we encouraged all students to keep in touch with the 
Railsbridge mailing list.  

### Feedback

We sent out a survey to all students after the workshop finished up.  
We received some really positive feedback.

69% of students responded that the workshop was excellent, with all 
students giving at least a 3 out of 5.

Some quotes:

---

>  I like the hands on curriculum.. It was very easy to follow and 
>  it was very easy to get the app going. It was great to meet everyone 
>  and everyone was so friendly & enthusiastic.

---

>  I was most taken aback by the willingness of everyone to help one 
>  another. Of course, that is what the TA's were there for, but it was 
>  great to see how they worked with the students and with one another 
>  to work through some difficult and unfamiliar issues.

---

We also asked for ways in which we could improve the workshop.  Some 
students suggested that the curriculum was a little complex.  However, 
some students felt the opposite.

---

>  There were a lot of different skillsets of the attendees -- some 
>  developers, some with no development experience at all. Obviously you 
>  had to lecture with no assumptions about the skillset. But it might be 
>  interesting to have different lectures for non-developers vs developers 
>  with no Ruby experience.

We're working on developing the curriculum to accomodating a wider range 
of expertise, possibly by adding more complicated extra credit.

## Start a RailsBridge chapter in your area

Since RailsBridge Boston started running its own workshops in August, we've
helped inspire more women's workshop efforts in other cities through the
writeups, photos, and survey results we've posted of our events. 

If you would like to get your own Ruby community to start doing its own
RailsBridge outreach, we are here to help, and so are the meta-organizers at
RailsBridge San Francisco. Please email
[railsbridgeboston@gmail.com](mailto:railsbridgeboston@gmail.com) if we've
helped inspire you to hold RailsBridge workshops in your area and would like
advice.  Please join the [RailsBridge Workshops Google
Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/railsbridge-workshops)
and introduce yourself there as well.
