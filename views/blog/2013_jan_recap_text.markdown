RailsBridge Boston held its third Ruby on Rails workshop for women
and their friends on January 18-19 at the intelligent.ly classroom
space in Boston, Massachusetts.  Thirty-seven attendees with wide-
ranging levels of experience worked through the 1.5 day curriculum.
The attendees were aided by fifteen experienced teaching assistants,
for a ration of 2.5 TAs per student.  The curriculum was
supplemented by six miniature lectures describing the full stack of
web development.  

This workshop was made possible by the folks at 
[intelligent.ly](http://intelligent.ly).  Not only did they provide
space in their beautiful building in the South End of Boston, but 
they also provided food and free t-shirts.  After we wrapped up on
Friday, we all decompressed at the nearby bar, 
[The Gallows](http://www.thegallowsboston.com/)

The purpose of these workshops has been to help ease process of 
getting into web development and programming.  There is a significant 
barrier to entry to get into these fields which results in an insular,
homogenous community.  This needs to be addressed.  In particular,
we found that the Ruby community lacks diversity.  We hoped to provide
special resources for women to get into Ruby.  Our goal is to have
attendees with no previous experience and take them through deploying
their own full-stack web application.  There were two significant 
influences on the workshop: a similar workshop by the [Boston Python Group](http://bostonpythonworkshop.com/)
and a Ruby workshop developed in San Francisco, [RailsBridge](http://workshops.railsbridge.org/).
This was our third workshop since beginning our outreach initiative.

and [November 2012](/blog/2012_nov_recap).  

The students who attended this workshop overwhelmingly appreciated the
experience. Fourteen out of thirty-seven students completed the exit 
survey.  All respondents gave the workshop a rating of 4 or 5 out of 5.
Seventy-nine percent rated it 5 out of 5.

##Feedback

![Jan 2013 Survey Results](/images/jan_2013/jan_2013_ratings.png)

We got a lot of positive feedback.  Many respondents pointed
to the high ratio of teaching assistants to students as being
critical to their success and enjoyment. Others appreciated the
pacing of the curriculum.  Here is a sample of some of the things
the students liked most:

--

>  The ability to play around independently but call over TA's whenever
>  I need help ... That way I didn't have to be afraid to "break"
>  anything and I was able to get down most of the important stuff
>  instead of just copying what was in the tutorial.

--

>  The pacing of the course - short lectures alternated with 
>  longer working sessions - made learning very enjoyable.

--

>  The student to teacher ratio was really good.

--

>  How helpful the instructors and TAs were -- the great ratio of
>  experienced teachers to inexperienced students really made a BIG
>  difference. I've never gotten so many questions answered so quickly
>  and patiently. Also, I really liked how hands-on everything was --
>  rather than just learning, we were hearing lectures and immediately
>  putting them to work, so much so that we had something to show at
>  the end of the day.

--

>  The TAs were wonderful and incredibly helpful.

--

>  Thank you so much! I couldn't believe that this workshop 
>  was free and so welcoming.

## What to improve in the future

We also asked students if there was anything we could improve in the
future. Many students experienced an information overload, and 
suggested taking more forced breaks.  

--

>  Personally, I found that the material towards the end of the class
>  was what I didn't really grasp. The beginning and middle I felt
>  like I had really absorbed. I'm not sure if this is b/c the long
>  hours

--

>  I feel as though it'd be awesome if it was split up into a few
>  classes over the course of a few weekends or weeknights. I felt a
>  bit of information overload.

--

>  I think there should be mandated breaks, maybe even a stretching
>  session for anyone who wants to participate.

--

Another common suggestion was to have some follow-up material 
prepared for graduating students to use as a next step.

--

>  It would have been great to have some sort of "Next project" for
>  someone to study afterwards. Even something really simple that they
>  could work towards on their own, before the next formal meetup.

--

>  Not sure if you do this already but how about a course that immediately
>  follows this one material-wise?
>
>  I knew most of the stuff taught (but still learned some great things
>  - and expanding my knowledge by asking the teachers about things
>  not featured in the curriculum) and would love a more advanced "next
>  steps" type course.

--

There were six mini-lectures interspersed throughout Saturday.  The goal
was to have the lectures give some personal explanation and set up the
section of the curriculum that followed.  While some students liked
the presentations, others pointed out that they were not relevant 
enough to the curriculum.

--

>  Lectures overall were great. ... It wasn't always clear
>  how the lectures related to the exercises that followed.

--

>  The lecture sections weren't very clear -- those sections were
>  brushed over very quickly and it may have been more effective to
>  skip some of them completely. High level mentions of concepts that
>  aren't fully explained can end up more intimidating.

##Next Steps

The feedback received from students will be helpful in planning the
next workshop.  While we are limited in both time and resources,
there are a few places where we feel we can improve the experiences
of the students and address some of the concerns above.

####Breaks
We will need to enforce break time.  It may be a good idea to have some
non-electronic activities planned, like a stretching break or some
ice breakers.  Hopefully this will foster more communication and
friendliness while protecting against burning our brains out.

####Follow-up Info
We will try to give a more formal description of next-step resources.
There are a number of excellent tutorials that are accessible online,
but if we don't point them out, they're lost in a sea of equally 
frustrating and confusing information.  

####Coordinate Lectures and Curriculum
According to some students, the lectures ended up being somewhat
confusing compared to the curriculum.  Hopefully we can coordinate
the lectures to be more in sync with each other and the steps of the
curriculum that they precede.

####Health/Safety Contingency
A student had a medical problem during the strenuous day.  We were lucky
to have great people there who knew how to respond, but it taught
us that we need to have a more formal contingency in case of emergency.

## Thank you

First and foremost, we thank our incredible teaching assistants, who are
the #1 reason RailsBridge Boston works:

making this workshop possible providing the space, food, and t-shirts.  Special
thanks goes to Sarah Hodges, who helped secure the venue.

We thank [BostonRB](http://bostonrb.org/) for serving as the backbone
and hub of the amazing Boston Ruby community.

Finally we are forever grateful to outreach organizers from both Boston Python
and RailsBridge San Francisco for showing us the way and inspiring us to
action.  Special thanks goes out to [Jessica
McKellar](http://web.mit.edu/jesstess/) and [Asheesh

Francisco](http://workshops.railsbridge.org/) who transmitted much RailsBridge wisdom. 

## The next workshop

We plan on holding our next RailsBridge Boston workshop very soon, possibly with an additional intermediate track.  We don't have a
final venue and date yet, but hopefully we'll sort that out soon.
