# Using the Command Prompt

There are three commands that we'll be using at a command prompt to navigate the filesystem on your computer:  

```text
ls
pwd
cd
```

`ls` lists the contents of a directory.  
`pwd` gives the full directory path to your current directory.  (It stands for "print working directory".)  
`cd` moves you into a new directory. (It stands for "change directory".)

Let's practice using these commands.  

## Open a command prompt
**OS X**

You can find the Terminal application through Spotlight, or navigate to `Applications/Utilities/Terminal` in Finder.

**Windows**

If you have installed Console2, open that from the shortcut you created.  
If you skipped that step, open Git Bash by going to "All Programs > RailsInstaller > Git Bash".

**Linux**

Ubuntu: Click the Ubuntu logo and start typing "Terminal".  
Fedora: From the Main Menu bar select "Applications > System Tools > Terminal".


### Practice using `ls`, `pwd`, and `cd`

Type each of these commands and hit enter:

```text
ls
```
This lists all the files in your home directory.

```text
pwd
```
This displays the full directory path to your current directory, which is your home directory.

```text
cd /
```
This will change you into the `/` root directory.

```text
ls
```
This lists the contents of the `/` root directory.

```text
cd Users    # OS X, Linux
cd /c/Users # Windows
```
This will change you into the `Users` subdirectory of the `/` root directory.

```text
ls
```
You should see a list of all the files in `/Users`, including the directory for your username—your home directory.

```text
pwd
```
This displays the full directory path to your current directory, `/Users`.

```text
cd ..
```
`..` means "parent directory", so this command moved you up to the parent directory. You were in `/Users`, so now you are in `/`, the root directory.

```text
ls
```
This lists the contents of the root directory, confirming where you are.

### Tab Completion
You can use Tab to auto-complete directory and file names. 
So from inside the root directory, if you type `cd U` and hit Tab, the command prompt will auto-complete the directory
name as much as it can.  

### Spaces in File and Folder Names
It's ok to include a space in a file or folder name, but it's a little tricky on the command line.
The command line expects a space means the end of a name, and you have to do extra work to show you mean a space.
Suppose you want to go to a folder called "My Files".

- The easiest way: type the beginning of the name and hit Tab for auto-complete.

```text
cd My<TAB>
```

- You can put the name inside double quotes or single quotes.

```text
cd "My Files"
cd 'My Files'
```

- You can put a backslash before the space. This is called "escaping".
It turns any character that the command line treats as special back into the un-special character. Space, backslash, and
single and double quotes are all special, and you'd write them as \ , \\, \', and \".

```text
cd My\ Files
```

- You can use a '\*', the wildcard character. Type in the beginning or end of the name and a \*
where it should fill in the blank, and hit Enter. If more than one file matches that pattern, you may get an error,
or the command line may pick the first match.

```text
cd My\*Files
cd My\*les
cd My\*
```


### Command History
The command prompt also maintains a command history. You can use the up arrow to cycle through old commands.

### Success!
You've practiced using `ls`, `pwd`, and `cd` to navigate your computer's filesystem from the command prompt.
