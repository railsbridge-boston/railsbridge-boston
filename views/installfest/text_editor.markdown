# Install a Text Editor

If you already are comfortable with a programming editor, use that one. Just double-check with an instructor to make 
sure it will work.  

If you are unsure, we suggest [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)


### 1. Install 

#### Windows
1. Download [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2).
1. Once the installer has finished downloading, open the Setup.exe
1. You will be prompted with a Security Warning. This is expected,
   confirm you want to install by clicking 'Run'
1. You will be prompted again asking if you want to make changes to your
   computer. Confirm by clicking 'Yes'.
1. Go through the Setup Wizard by clicking 'Next', 'Next', 'Next',
   'Install'
1. After the installation is complete click 'Finish' to exit the Setup
   Wizard.

#### OSX

1. Download [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2). 
1. Once the installer has finished downloading, open Finder from your dock.  
1. On the left side of the Finder, under "Favorites" you should see `Downloads`. Open it.  
1. Inside the `Downloads` folder you should find the `Sublime Text 2.x.x.dmg` — double click it to open it.  
1. That will open the Sublime Text installer disk image in the Finder window in front of you. Drag `Sublime Text 2` into 
`Applications`.
1. (optional) To edit files in Sublime Text from the command line,
you need to add a `symlink`. This will allow you to
type `subl Gemfile` (for instance) on the command line
to edit your Gemfile.
Type this command in the Terminal:

```text
sudo ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" /usr/bin/subl
```

#### Linux
These are directions tested for Kubuntu/Ubuntu version 13.04, although it will probably work on other distributions such as Mint.

Open a terminal window, and enter these commands:
```text
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/sublime-text-2
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sublime-text
```
You can then start it from the same terminal window with:
```text
/usr/bin/sublime-text
```
However, a pretty icon has also been created, and you can start it from the Graphical User Interface (GUI)

Sorry we don't have instructions ready for Fedora, so please ask a TA for help.

### 2. Open your Editor

#### Windows

1. To start Sublime Text 2 please select it from the Start Menu under
   'All Programs'

![Submlime Text 2](../../public/images/installfest/sublime2.png?raw=true)

#### OSX

1. Double-click the `Applications` folder in the disk image, or navigate to `Applications` in the left panel of 
Finder.  
1. In `Applications`, scroll down until you see `Sublime Text 2`.
1. Double-click `Sublime Text 2` to open the editor.

#### Linux

Type this in the Terminal to start Sublime:

```text
/usr/bin/sublime-text
```
Or, you can use your GUIs menus, as an icon has most likely been installed.

### 3. Set some basic preferences

Sublime Text 2 reads its preferences from text files. This means you can easily
edit settings, check your settings into version control, or share settings with
copy & paste. That's what we're going to do with some common preferences for
Rubyists.

Open up User Settings (`Sublime Text 2 > Preferences > Settings - User`) and paste in these preferences:

```json
{
  "tab_size": 2,
  "translate_tabs_to_spaces": true,
  "trim_trailing_white_space_on_save": true,
  "ensure_newline_at_eof_on_save": true,
  "save_on_focus_lost": true
}
```

Save the User Settings file (`File > Save`). Your new preferences are now in effect.

### Success!

Now you have an editor that you can use to open any text file, including Ruby programs.
